# Project Management Application

## Project Overview
This application is designed to facilitate project management by providing tools for task organization, team collaboration, issue tracking, and file management. It helps teams streamline workflows, improve productivity, and track project progress efficiently.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Provide a **user-friendly** platform for project management.
- Support **task assignment**, tracking, and collaboration.
- Offer **cloud-based storage** for file attachments.
- Ensure **efficient user management** with role-based access.
- Support **multi-platform access** via web and mobile applications.


## Use Case Scenarios
### 1. **Project Creation and Management**
   - A user (Project Owner) creates a new project by specifying a title, description, and team members.
   - The owner assigns roles to members (e.g., admin, member, guest).
   - The project progresses through different stages (e.g., Planning, In Progress, Completed).

### 2. **Task Assignment and Tracking**
   - The project owner or team members create tasks, define priorities, and assign responsible members.
   - Users update task statuses (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
   - Tasks have deadlines and may be linked to issues for better tracking.

### 3. **Issue Reporting and Resolution**
   - Users report issues related to specific tasks or projects.
   - Issues can be assigned to specific members or left open for all team members to respond.
   - Team members provide responses or solutions, and the issue is marked as resolved once completed.

### 4. **File Management System (ASS - Application Storage System)**
   - Users upload and attach files to projects or tasks.
   - Files are stored in a cloud storage service.
   - Access permissions ensure that only relevant team members can view or download files.

### 5. **Collaboration and Communication (ACS - Application Communication System)**
   - Users can comment on tasks and issues for better collaboration.
   - A chat system allows real-time discussions.
   - Future updates may include voice and video calls.

### 6. **AI Assistance (AAIA - Application AI Assistance)**
   - AI suggestions for task prioritization.
   - AI-based summarization of project progress.
   - Automated reminders and notifications.

## Project Workflow
1. Users register and log in.
2. Projects are created with team members assigned.
3. Tasks and issues are added, with real-time updates and notifications.
4. Files are uploaded and managed securely.
5. AI assistance helps optimize workflow efficiency.
